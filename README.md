# Lesson Planning App 

# How to run this project locally
1. Clone this repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v40-bears-team-37.git
    ```
2. Move into v40-bears-team-37 directory 
    ```sh
    cd v40-bears-team-37 
    ```
3. Install dependencies
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```
4. Move into the server app and start it
    ```sh
    cd server
    yarn start
    ```
5. Move into the client app and start it
    ```sh
    cd client
    yarn start
    ```
5.  Both applications should be running!
    For client go to: `localhost:3000`
    For server go to: `localhost:4000`

6.  Create a .env file in the root directory when you get a chance. For now it can be empty.

7.  You can also start the server and client together by moving into the root directory and running
    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```
    Please note that you have to start the server and client separately at least once for this to work (I'm not too sure why ...?!?!)
